#### Passwords Manager Plan

Language: Python3  
Database: PostgreSql  
GUI: Terminal Menu

---  

Very simple **passwords manager** that stores your passwords in a database. In order to access them you need to enter you "Master Key".
The database in hosted locally, so if you won't be able to actually use the app.  

Further optimizations could be:
1. Hosting a database on a server
2. Improving passwords security
3. Adding more options to the menu
